# Customer-Segmentation - KMeans
Customer segmentation using an unsupervised learning algorithm

The dataset I have used is from Kaggle - Mall Customer  Dataset 
- In this project, I applied unsupervised machine learning to perform customer segmentation based on their purchase behavior.
- I chose K-means as the clustering algorithm because it is simple, fast, and efficient for large datasets.
- To find the optimal number of clusters, I used the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) as the evaluation metric and plotted the elbow curve to identify the point where the WCSS decreases significantly.
- I visualized the clusters using scatter plots, bar charts, box plots, and other techniques to explore the characteristics and differences of each cluster.
- The goal of this project was to gain insights into the customer segments and provide recommendations for marketing strategies and customer retention.
